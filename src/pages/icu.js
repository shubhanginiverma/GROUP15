                  This Website is one of the best critical care website in
                  India. Critical care or Intensive care is a crucial medical
                  specialty caring for patients who are critically ill. They may
                  require support for instability (hypertension/hypotension),
                  airway or respiratory compromise (ventilator support), acute
                  renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, or the cumulative effects
                  of multiple organ failure, more commonly referred to now as
                  multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Patients needing
                  intensive/invasive monitoring, such as in the crucial hours
                  after major surgery or patients who are considered too
                  unstable to transfer to a less intensively monitored unit may
                  also be placed in the intensive care units.
